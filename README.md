# Deepdream

My implementation of Google's [Deepdream](https://github.com/google/deepdream) deep learning image processing software.

Supports JPG and PNG images. Full alpha transparency support for PNGs.

Run with `python main.py` and go from there. All input images must be located in the `Inputs` folder.
